## Overview

The system is designed to:

1. **Extract** tourism data (hotels, restaurants, attractions) from multiple sources using web crawling and APIs.
2. **Transform** raw data (cleaning, deduplication, schema normalization, missing value handling) with Python or ODI.
3. **Load** processed data into a centralized **Data Warehouse** (MySQL/Oracle) using Star Schema.
4. Provide **interactive dashboards** in Power BI/Tableau to analyze and visualize tourism trends, prices, ratings, and seasonal patterns.
