         "Bon Mi – With 7 years of perfecting the Vietnamese sandwich, we bring the bold flavors of Saigon to Hanoi. Our signature 26 cm banh mi—Hanoi’s biggest—is crafted from premium brown wheat and rye flour, finished with a golden oat-crusted crunch. Baked fresh at 450°F, it’s crispy outside, soft inside, and packed with flavor. Savor our mouthwatering fillings: flame-broiled sirloin, juicy coconut-braised pork belly, rich annatto tofu with shiitake pâté, or the ultimate Saigon-style cold cuts featuring 9 expertly curated meats. Every bite bursts with bold flavors, fresh herbs, and house-made sauces, delivering the perfect balance of savory, tangy, and spicy. Pair your banh mi with our authentic Vietnamese coffee, slow-dripped for deep, aromatic intensity. Whether bold and black or creamy with condensed milk, it’s the perfect companion. We take pride in top-tier hygiene, fresh ingredients, and unbeatable taste. Come hungry, leave happy—only at Bon Mi, home of Hanoi’s best banh mi!",

As reference, La Badiane is rated top 500 Restaurants in Asia by The Miele Guide, has been recommended by The New York Times, and has received 5 consecutive Certificates of Excellence by Trip Advisor -since 2011. Indeed, with more than 300 upvotes as “EXCELLENT”, La Badiane knows a high rating deserved to top-end restaurants. Yet, if most is about tastes, fusion of flavors and international gastronomy, great attention is also constantly paid to the quality of the service provided as well as to the overall atmosphere, so guests have a unique culinary experience by enjoying every aspect of their meal. When coming in, one’s attention is instantly caught by the multitude of perfumes & aromas flowing out from the open front kitchen. The entrance corridor planted with harmonious luxuriant vegetation leads you towards the heart of the restaurant, and its glass covered patio. Surrounded by carefully chosen leaf plants, walls predominantly white, and large B&W photo portraits, the place provides for a true feeling of calm and elegance. The combination of tablecloths, two-color curtains, and the green vegetation gathers all conditions to let guests’ visual and gustative senses fully express themselves. The attentive and discreet lightening in the evening makes it very romantic, and live classic music concerts every Wednesday evening levels-up La Badiane restaurant to turn it into a complete place. On the upper floor, two rooms available provide for perfect intimate spaces, appropriate for guests either looking for privacy, or mid-size groups wishing to enjoy a private lunch or dinner on a special occasion. As opposed to the ground floor and its B&W photos, the first floor presents large-size color portraits. A must-see.",

         "Founded in December 2008, La Badiane -French for Star Anise spice- is heralding its claim to be one of the best restaurants in Vietnam, dedicated to fusion of flavors and international gastronomy. As reference, La Badiane is rated top 500 Restaurants in Asia by The Miele Guide, has been recommended by The New York Times, and has received 5 consecutive Certificates of Excellence by Trip Advisor -since 2011. Indeed, with more than 300 upvotes as “EXCELLENT”, La Badiane knows a high rating deserved to top-end restaurants. Yet, if most is about tastes, fusion of flavors and international gastronomy, great attention is also constantly paid to the quality of the service provided as well as to the overall atmosphere, so guests have a unique culinary experience by enjoying every aspect of their meal. When coming in, one’s attention is instantly caught by the multitude of perfumes & aromas flowing out from the open front kitchen. The entrance corridor planted with harmonious luxuriant vegetation leads you towards the heart of the restaurant, and its glass covered patio. Surrounded by carefully chosen leaf plants, walls predominantly white, and large B&W photo portraits, the place provides for a true feeling of calm and elegance. The combination of tablecloths, two-color curtains, and the green vegetation gathers all conditions to let guests’ visual and gustative senses fully express themselves. The attentive and discreet lightening in the evening makes it very romantic, and live classic music concerts every Wednesday evening levels-up La Badiane restaurant to turn it into a complete place. On the upper floor, two rooms available provide for perfect intimate spaces, appropriate for guests either looking for privacy, or mid-size groups wishing to enjoy a private lunch or dinner on a special occasion. As opposed to the ground floor and its B&W photos, the first floor presents large-size color portraits. A must-see.",
